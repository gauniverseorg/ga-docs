# Aggregation

The Aggregation enum represents different types of aggregations that can be applied to a column or expression in data processing operations. It includes the following aggregation types:

- None: Indicates no aggregation operation is applied
- Sum: Represents the sum aggregation, which calculates the total sum of values
- Max: Represents the maximum aggregation, which retrieves the maximum value
- Min: Represents the minimum aggregation, which retrieves the minimum value
- Avg: Represents the average aggregation, which calculates the average value
- Count: Represents the count aggregation, which counts the number of values
- NotSet: Indicates that the aggregation type has not been set or specified
- DistinctCount: Represents the distinct count aggregation, which counts the number of unique values

The Aggregation enum is often used in data analysis, reporting, and querying scenarios where aggregating data based on specific criteria is required.

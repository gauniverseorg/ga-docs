# Concat

The Concat enum represents logical concatenation operators used in combining multiple conditions or clauses in a logical expression. It includes the following concatenation operators:

- AND: Represents the logical "AND" operator. It combines two conditions and returns true only if both conditions are true.
- OR: Represents the logical "OR" operator. It combines two conditions and returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.

The Concat enum is typically used in filter expressions or query conditions to specify how multiple conditions should be combined to form a complete logical expression. It allows for the construction of complex filtering logic by specifying the logical relationship between individual conditions.

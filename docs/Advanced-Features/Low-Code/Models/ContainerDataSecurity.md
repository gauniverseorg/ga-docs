# ContainerDataSecurity

This class represents the security settings for data within a container. The class has the following properties:

- Access: Represents the data access level using the DataAccess enumeration. It specifies the permissions or restrictions on accessing the data.
- IsStar: Indicates whether the data security applies to all fields (true) or specific fields (false) within the container.
- GroupId: Represents the group identifier associated with the data security settings.
- Filter: Represents the container field filter to further restrict access to specific fields within the container.

By using the ContainerDataSecurity class, you can define and manage the security settings for data within a container, including access levels, field restrictions, and filtering.

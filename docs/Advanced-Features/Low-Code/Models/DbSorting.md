# DbSorting

The DbSorting enum is used to represent the sorting order in a database query. It has two possible values:

- ASC: Represents ascending order. It indicates that the query results should be sorted in ascending order based on the specified column or property.
- DESC: Represents descending order. It indicates that the query results should be sorted in descending order based on the specified column or property

The DbSorting enum is typically used in database-related operations, such as constructing queries or specifying sorting criteria for retrieving data from a database. It provides a convenient way to specify the desired sorting order in a clear and readable manner.

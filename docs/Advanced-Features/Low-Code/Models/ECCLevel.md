# ECCLevel

The ECCLevel enum represents the error correction capability levels for QR codes. QR codes can have different levels of error correction to ensure data integrity and readability. The enum includes the following error correction levels:

- L: Represents the lowest error correction level. It provides a small amount of error correction capacity
- M: Represents a medium error correction level. It provides a moderate amount of error correction capacity
- Q: Represents a high error correction level. It provides a high amount of error correction capacity
- H: Represents the highest error correction level. It provides the maximum amount of error correction capacity

The choice of error correction level depends on factors such as the expected damage or distortion the QR code may undergo and the desired level of data integrity. Higher error correction levels can recover more data even if the QR code is partially damaged or obscured but result in larger QR codes.

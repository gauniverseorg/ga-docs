# StructureAccess

It represents the different levels of access or permissions that can be granted to a container's structure. The enumeration consists of three members

- None: Represents no access or permission to the container's structure.
- Read: Represents read-only access to the container's structure.
- Change: Represents the ability to modify or change the container's structure

By using this enumeration, you can assign one of these access levels to the Access property of the ContainerSecurity class to indicate the level of access granted to the container's structure.

# Overview

Low code is used to simplify the development process of business applications, it allows rigidity and flexibility in the application, all with writing the minimum required code. Some problems are too complicated to be solved by just regular no code components. For that reason, GA gives you the ability to execute typescript code inside your workflows. The code can be executed during any workflow either in the service or client side.

We offer two internal script libraries that can be used for most tasks in low code, these are System and Models, these two libraries are used for tasks in service side work flows.

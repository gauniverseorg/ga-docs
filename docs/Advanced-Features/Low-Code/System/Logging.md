# Logging

This class provides a static method called WriteConsole for writing log messages to the console.
Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The class imports the evidanza.Shared.Queries namespace at the beginning of the code.
- The class has a single static method called WriteConsole.
- The WriteConsole method takes a single parameter of type string named log, which represents the log message to be written to the console.
- Inside the WriteConsole method, the Console.WriteLine method is called to write the log message to the console.

This LoggingWrapper class can be used as a utility class to centralize logging functionality. By calling the WriteConsole method and passing a log message as an argument, you can easily write log messages to the console output.

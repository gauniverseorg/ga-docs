# Regex

This class serves as a wrapper for performing regular expression operations using the Regex class. The class provides several static methods for working with regular expressions:

- Match: Searches the input string for a single match using the specified regular expression pattern
- IsMatch: Determines whether the input string matches the specified regular expression pattern
- Matches: Searches the input string for all occurrences of a regular expression pattern and returns a collection of matches
- Replace: Replaces all occurrences of a regular expression pattern in the input string with a specified replacement string

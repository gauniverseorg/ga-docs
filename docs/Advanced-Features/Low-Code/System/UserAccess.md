# UserAccess

This class serves as a wrapper for working with user-related functionality, including user management and authentication. The class provides several static methods for working with user-related functionality:

- GetAllUsers: Retrieves a list of all users.
- GetCurrentUser: Retrieves the current user.
- FindUser: Finds a user by their ID.
- AddOrUpdateUser: Adds or updates a user.
- DeleteUser: Deletes a user.
- ResetMFA: Resets multi-factor authentication for a user.
- ContactPortal: Contacts the portal to refresh user information.

The methods in this class interact with the user management and authentication system, such as loading users, saving user data, deleting users, and resetting multi-factor authentication.

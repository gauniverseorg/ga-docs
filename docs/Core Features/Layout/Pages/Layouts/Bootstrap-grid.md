# Bootstrap Grid

[Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) works like a normal grid with rows and columns; however, rows and columns are set automatically based on the elements inserted. Each 4 elements are in a separate row. It is responsive depending on the viewport (Mobile, Desktop, etc.).

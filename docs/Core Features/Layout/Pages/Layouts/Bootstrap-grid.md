# Bootstrap Grid

[Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) works like a normal grid with rows and columns; however, rows and columns are set automatically based on the elements inserted. Each element can have different sizes depending on four screen sizes, and they are: Small-sm, Medium-md, Large-lg and Extra Large-xl.

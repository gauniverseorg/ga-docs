# Flex

Flex is a unidirectional element that include different elements and distribute the space between them as specified. Orientation can be changed to be horizontal or vertical. Orientation also has different variations, like reverse which shows the elements in reverse order, wrapping which wraps any element in a new line, and reverse wrapping which does what the previous two do.
Items can be aligned according to the following options: (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch, inherit, initial, unset). Content can be aligned according to the following options: (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch, inherit, initial, unset).

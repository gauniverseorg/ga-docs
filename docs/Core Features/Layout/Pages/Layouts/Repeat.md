# Repeat

Allows for repetition of elements. Ex. When wanting to display an unknown number of images. A list is passed to the repeat control. The control on it is repeated for each list entry. In the case of data binding, the Data Source must be set above it in the layout tree. Accessing the repeat tab allows you to change the following: Orientation (Vertical, Horizontal, Reverse, Wrapping, and different variations of the orientations like Horizontal Reverse), Align Items (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch, inherit, initial, unset), align content (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch, inherit, initial, unset), Disable Auto Load, UseVerticalScroll, Page Size.

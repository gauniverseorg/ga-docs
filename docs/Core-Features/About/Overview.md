# Overview

Here you can find general information about the version of the instance as well as revert or go back to the previous versions. You can also find information about the capsule of the instance, meaning that you can check what is the difference between this environment and another environment.

## Capsule Overview

 View all elements that were marked as a capsule and what changes happened to them, for most users this page might not be helpful since it is only used in controlling different versions of the same application, for example between development and production environments.

## ChangeLog Overview

Here you can view all the tracked changed that happened in the current instance by each user. The tracked changes include:

1. Pages
2. Navigation
3. Workflows
4. Scripts

You can either accept or delete any change made by a user. All changes are saved to their account until they are accepted and made public for all accounts.

When accepting a change you can select an overwrite If overwrite is checked, then no new version of the element (layout, workflow, etc.) will be created and the currently active version will be overwritten. This means that the previous state can no longer be restored. If the checkbox is unchecked (default), then the currently active version is saved and set to inactive and the new version is set to active.

## Versioning Overview

Here you can see each change that happened in the instance and revert them as intended, you can revert each change independently of each other, meaning that you can for example revert a workflow but keep the new layout as it is.
Note: You should place huge care which changes are reverted since it might cause some pages or functionalities to stop working if they donâ€™t match the changes.

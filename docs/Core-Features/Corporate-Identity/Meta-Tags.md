# Meta Tags

Meta Tags are used in search engine optimization. The meta tags used on the website are managed here, which can be overwritten with the help of the Global setting of meta tags. Some tags like the **Title** tag change the title for the application as a whole. On a page basis, meta tags can be maintained with WFB.

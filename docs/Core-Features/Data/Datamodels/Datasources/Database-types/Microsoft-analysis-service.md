| Server                     | Database server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Database                   | Name of the database on the database server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| PreloadingDimensions       | IDs of the dimensions whose members are to be loaded when the service starts (e.g., “View Dim Customers”). Multiple dimensions are to be separated by semicolons (;). (e.g., Dim1; Dim2; Dim3) For RolePlayingDimension the CubeDimensionID is to be entered                                                                              |
| DateFormatStrings          | Different Time/Dimension Formats can be given here (e.g., YYYYMMDD) If individual dimensions are stored with a different time/date format, they can be listed individually under DimensionFormatStrings (Note: Time dimensions with IntKeys are not supported in many functions)                                             |
| DimensionFormatStrings     | Individual dimensions with other Time-/Date-Format (e.g., DimensionID: TimeIntKey FormatString: YYYYMMDD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| MaxSecurityKeyCombinations | For Drillthrough, the software determines the LevelMember of the key attributes of all dimensions for the SQL query. The combination of these keys must not exceed this limit                                                                                                                                            |
| ConnectionTimeOut          | The maximum waiting time until the connection is terminated. The Analysis Service should not provide any feedback when reading out the database structure. Default = 0 = infinite                                                                                                                                          |
| SecurityPassThrough        | If the user has a database role with dimension data restrictions, it is queried for filters/selects on the AS which dimension elements the user is allowed to see. If the checkmark is not set, the software uses the database role to calculate which dimension elements are displayed for the user in the filter/select |
| DefaultShowAttributes      | Automatic show of the attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

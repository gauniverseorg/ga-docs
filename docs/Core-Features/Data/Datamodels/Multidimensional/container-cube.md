Here you can add the dimensions you want to use in the cube

Available properties are:

## Values

Here you can define the values or measurements that you want to show in the graphs, for example the count or summation of sales.

Available properties:

| Property    | Description¬†                                                                                                                                          |

| Aggregator¬† | How the value should be calculated <li>None</li><li>Sum</li><li>Max</li><li>Min</li><li>Avg</li><li>Count</li><li>Not set</li><li>Distinct count</li> |
| Formula     | If you want to create a new measurement type or aggregator type                                                                                       |

## Data Mapping

Here you can define the values from the facts table/container you have. After selecting the table you can select which column of the table will be mapped to which column in the mapped dimensions.

Available properties:

| Property | Description¬†                                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üñä        | Edit current partition: Upon clicking this edit query definition is opened |

## Edit query definition

Here you can select the table and which fields to include in the dimension. After dragging and dropping a table into the query, you can select the fields which can be inserted, a gray check mark means that it is required, a green check mark means that it is optional and can be omitted. You can also select the aggregation type from here, but it is not recommended.

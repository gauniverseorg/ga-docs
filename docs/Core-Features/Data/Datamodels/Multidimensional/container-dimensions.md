## Edit query definition

Here you can select the table and which fields to include in the dimension. After dragging and dropping a table into the query, you can select the fields which can be inserted, a gray check mark means that it is required, a green check mark means that it is optional and can be omitted. You can also select the aggregation type from here, but it is not recommended.

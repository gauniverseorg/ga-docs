# Formula Editor

The formula editor is used for defining formulas which can be either logical, mathematical, or text comparison. Values can be used as character strings using the toJSON() function in the formula editor. When you want to use a string text you must enter it inside a quotation mark.

Translate() can be used to translate messages by accessing the key from Settings - Settings - Translations here.

# Specific Navigation

Here you can define the nodes and sub nodes for the application which can be viewed by the user. Main nodes are specific pages in your application, for example you might have a profile main node. Sub nodes are more specific pages in your application, for example you might have profile/settings, which is nested inside the profile main node. In the lower left field Main- and Sub nodes can be created, the available properties when creating a node are:

| Property | Description |

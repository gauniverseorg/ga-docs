# Grid

The grid element enables you to transform your page into a grid layout, giving you the flexibility to showcase content according to your preferences.

ColumnDefinitions and RowDefinitions are utilized to divide a page into a specified number of rows and columns, giving you control over the layout. You can easily change the size of each column or row using their respective properties. To explore the full range of available size units, refer to the MDN web documentation. Notably, in the context of Grid Area, commonly used size units include Pixel, Percent, em, Auto, Rest, fr, vw, vh, and calc. These units provide flexibility when determining the dimensions of columns and rows, allowing you to create a page layout that suits your specific needs.

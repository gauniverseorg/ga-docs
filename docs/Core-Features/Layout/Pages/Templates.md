# Templates

Here you can find all the templates which have been defined under Settings – Layout – Templates. When inserting a template into a page you must have a data source selected on any element above it, this is done so that the template knows where to find the data. If the template is used to repeat all data of a data source, the template should be placed inside a repeat layout.

Note: Checking Load By Reference on the element, and inside the actual template prevents it from loading.

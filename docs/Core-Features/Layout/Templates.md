# Templates

Templates are predesigned pages that can be dropped to another page to expedite the development process.

For example, if you have a certain type of grid that is used on different pages, it could be beneficial to have it as a template so that you can:

- Save time in replicating it
- Save time in changing it
- Standardize the development process

## Template Creation

1. Go to Settings â€“ Layout â€“ Templates
2. Click on the + Create New button
3. Open the template using the ðŸ–‰:
    1. Change the name of template "New Template" to a name of your liking
    2. Set the data source on renamed element
    3. Insert text blocks or other elements that can store the data
    4. Data bind the variables into the elements

## Editing Templates

1. From the creation page select template
2. Click on the edit button (ðŸ–‰)

## Inserting Into Page

1. Go to page you want to insert into
2. In the base select the data source, also select overflow scroll and position absolute, since you might want to make the page scrollable
3. Insert a repeat element inside the base
    - You can insert it into a another layout element if its not a list of data objects
4. From the toolbox pick select templates
5. Look up template name
6. Drag and drop template into repeat element, make sure to select load by reference since you want to load it using the default options not new ones

## Template Settings

Load by reference allows mirroring of changes to and from the original template page.

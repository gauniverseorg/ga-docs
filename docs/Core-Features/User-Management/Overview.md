# Overview

To have a truly secure application, GA offers different roles and access permissions and groups. These are all granular roles that can be customized by the user to allow complete access to who can see and do what on any page. The users who have access to this instance, can be authorized here. User permissions are divided as follows:

- Instance group that contains instance roles and instance users
- Instance user that includes providers and one or more instance roles
- Instance role that includes multiple user permissions, built-in instance roles, navigation and container permissions

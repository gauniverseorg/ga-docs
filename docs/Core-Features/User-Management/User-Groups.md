# Groups

This is the page where you can add, delete and edit user groups. User groups are used when you have multiple roles that need to be applied to multiple users. When creating a group, you must give it a unique name. The options here are:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Selected only | Show only active roles |
| User | The users assigned to this group |
| Roles | The roles assigned to this group |

# Testing in GA

Testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle. With the help of testing, one can ensure that our application is ready for deployment and use. It helps identify defects and makes sure the application works with the new and updated changes.

This documentation provides ways to test and validate your GA_Universe applications using standard testing tools like Selenium. This guide is for both technical and non-technical users to help them test web applications using either recorded test scripts or automated scripts.

## Guidelines for Conducting Tests in GA_Universe

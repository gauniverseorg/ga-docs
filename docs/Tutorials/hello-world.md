# Hello, World!

How to use GA to create your first "Hello, world!" page

## Using GA is as simple as

- Creating the page
- Choosing the control elements you want to use
- Dropping in place
- Configure as needed

## Create a page from settings

1.  Navigate to /default/settings/

2.  Go to the layout tab.

3.  Go to the pages tab.

4.  Name your page and give your URL. For example, let's name it "HelloPage"

- Note: The URL is how you navigate to it and the name is how you can search for it in the backend and so on.

6.  Then chose the type of page, for now we will start with an empty page.

7.  Click OK.

## Create navigation

1. Navigate to the settings backend
2. Go to layout tab
3. Go to navigation tab
4. Go to overview tab
5. Click the + button in the bottom left corner
6. Name it and make the home page the one created earlier "HelloPage". Also name the navigation "Hello Navigation"
7. Save

## Open the page

Navigate to /NAME OF NAVIGATION/NAME OF PAGE/, for this example the path is /HelloNavigation/HelloPage/
Note: Because HelloPage is the homepage for the navigation, there is no need to explicitly write it, as /HelloNavigation/ will direct to the homepage

## Drop Text Block and write "Hello, world!"

1. Open the AppBuilder by clicking F2 on the keyboard
2. Open the Toolbox tab
3. Open the controls tab
4. Find TextBlock element. (You can use the search bar if you're having trouble finding an element)
5. Drag the TextBlock and drop it into the base grid
6. Click on the TextBlock and modify the properties which can be found on the right
7. When modifying the TextBlock properties, change the text property to "Hello World!
8. Save and close the AppBuilder using F2

That's it! Now you can use your newly made page to test out what GA can offer

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have a basic understanding of mobile app components such as app names, icons, URLs, and identifiers. This knowledge will be crucial as you navigate through the app creation process in GA_Universe.

## Starting the Mobile App Generation

### Initial Setup

1. Locate the 'Generate Mobile App' section in the settings area of GA_Universe. Remember, you can only generate one mobile app at a time. Hereâ€™s how to start:

2. Choose the action you wish to perform - either editing an existing app or building a new one. If you are building a new app click on the "+ Create New" button on the top

3. Or if you editing one please click on the pen icon under the actions section.

#### Creation and Editing Interface

- This section is where the magic happens. You will create or edit your mobile app using the following properties:

##### Essential App Information

- ***App Name***: Choose a name that resonates with the app's purpose.
- ***Icon***: Upload the icon. Ensure it is clear and recognizable (Size should be 1024*1024 for best quality, And must be **.jpeg**).
- ***BaseURL***: Set the BaseURL (e.g., <https://develop.gauniv.com/HelloNavigation/login>). This directs users to the intended page upon application start.
- ***Email***: Enter the email address where the notification is sent.
- ***Identifier***: An automatically generated wildcard app ID (e.g., com.gauniv.DevsyApp).

##### Building for Android and iOS

  - ***Team ID***: Enter the Team ID assigned by Apple.

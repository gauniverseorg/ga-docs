### Page Types

| Page Type    | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty        | Clean page that can be built from scratch to your liking                                                                                  |
| Copy         | A copy of an already existing page. It is not a reference, so changes will not be synchronized between them                               |
| List Detail  | Template for a page that already has a data table so the data can be manipulated. A datasource need to be selected prior to page creation |
| Table Detail | Similar to List Detail in functionality but differs in format                                                                             |

### Layouts

These are the frames of the page. By default, the page would have a grid.

Each type of layout has different properties, like how a grid is mostly rigid and a bootstrap grid is more flexible.
